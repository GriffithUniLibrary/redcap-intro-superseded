### Branching logic

You can decide to show or hide specific questions based on the results of previous questions, including the results of calculated questions. Here, we are going to show a participant a warning about their BMI if it is over a certain value. 

{% include alert.html text="Branching logic cannot be tested until the survey is published." color="warning" %}
 
{% capture bmiwarning %}
1.	Click `Add Field`
2.	Choose `Descriptive Text` (with optional Image/Video) for the `Field Type`.
3.	In the `Field` Label, type the following:
    Based on the information you've provided, your BMI (body mass index) is in a range associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. 
4.	In the `Variable Name`, type bmi_warning.
5.	Click `Save`. 
6.	Click the `Branching Logic Button` ( ).
7.	Select the `Drag-N-Drop Logic Builder`. 
8.	Drag bmi = (define criteria) to the right column. 
9.	Select greater than (`>`) and type 30 in the value field. 
10.	Note that the equation `[bmi] > 30` also appears in the Advanced Branching Logic Syntax section above. 
{% endcapture %}
{% include card.html header="Create a BMI warning" text=bmiwarning %}


### Stop Actions

You can end the survey automatically based on a participant’s answers to a question.
Stop Actions cannot be tested until the survey is published. 

{% capture stopaction %}
1.	Click Return to list of instruments.
2.	Choose the Baseline Health Data instrument.
3.	Scroll to the question that reads: Do you suffer from any of the following conditions?
Click the red   button in the question menu.
4.	Select Asthma and click Save. 
5.	Note that the Asthma option now has [End Survey] alongside it in red. 

{% include alert.html text="Note that Stop Actions don’t support ending the survey based on multiple conditions (e.g. `[Age] > 45 AND [Diabetes] = YES)` but you may be able to achieve a similar result using a combination of Branching and Stop Actions." color="info" %}

{% endcapture %}
{% include card.html header="Create a Stop Action" text=stopaction %}

### Action tags

Action tags can help format or adapt entries automatically. For example they can limit the number of characters a participant enters in a field, or prevent them from selecting more than a certain number of options. 
Here we are going to create a ‘None of the Above’ checkbox option, that automatically unchecks all the other boxes, and unchecks itself if any other box is ticked. 

{% capture actiontag %}
1.	Click the `edit` button ( ) next to the question labelled Do you suffer from any of the following conditions? 
2.	Add a new option to the list of options as follows: `5, None of the above`. 
3.	In the `Action Tags` field, type `@NONEOFTHEABOVE=5`. This indicates that the answer option coded as ‘5’ operates as the ‘none of the above’ option. 

{% include alert.html text="Note that we can only test this action tag by looking at the live survey, once it has been published." color="info" %}

{% endcapture %}
{% include card.html header="Add ‘None of the Above’ to the Existing Conditions’ question" text=actiontag %}
